# pyyed Real-Life-Examples

[pyyed](https://github.com/jamesscottbrown/pyyed) is a simple Python library to export networks to [yEd](http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.html).

Is is [available from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyyed/).

The [yEd Graph Editor](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed) supports the [GraphML](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/) ([GraphML Primer](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/primer/graphml-primer.html)) file format. 
This is an open standard based on XML, and is supported by Python libraries such as [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/).
However, the details of formatting (rather than network topology) are handled by yEd specific extensions to the standard, which are not supported by other libraries.
 
[pyyed](https://github.com/jamesscottbrown/pyyed) is a sublime library to create graphml formatted diagrams .  However, I feel that a couple of real life examples are missing in the repo to bring the user on speed.  That's why I have created this repo here.
