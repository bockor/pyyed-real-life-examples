# pyyed Real-Life-Examples

[pyyed](https://github.com/jamesscottbrown/pyyed) is a simple Python library to export networks to [yEd](http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_about.html).

Is is [available from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyyed/).

The [yEd Graph Editor](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed) supports the [GraphML](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/) ([GraphML Primer](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/primer/graphml-primer.html)) file format. 
This is an open standard based on XML, and is supported by Python libraries such as [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/).
However, the details of formatting (rather than network topology) are handled by yEd specific extensions to the standard, which are not supported by other libraries.
 
[pyyed](https://github.com/jamesscottbrown/pyyed) is a sublime library to create graphml formatted diagrams .  However, I feel that a couple of real life examples are missing in the repo to bring the user on speed.  That's why I have created this repo here.

## Choose the optimal yED Graph Layout
You can select a graph type and a sample graph will show up. This graph can be edited to suit your needs, as you can add text, change shape colors and select the formatting of the graph with easy to use options. Furthermore, the automatic layout algorithm ("One-Click Layout" Button in the Main Toolbar) of this application allows auto-arranging graphs regardless of their data size.

You can easily change the diagram layout in just a few clicks by selecting the layout type from the Layout drop down menu. This menu provides a number of layout types which can be selected to quickly alter your diagram. The available layouts include; Hierarchical, Organic, Orthogonal, Circular, Tree, Edge Routing, Label Placement, Selection (Partial), Components, Random, Swimlane, Flowchart, BPMN and Family Tree.  Checkout the yEd Help function (F1) and select then Layout Algorithms.

Most of **my (network)diagrams** excel using Hierarchial or Organic Layout.

## Finally
Suggestions and remarks are welcome.  Don't hesitate to contribute if you can't resist.
